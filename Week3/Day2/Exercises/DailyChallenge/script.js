/*
In todays exercise we will be creating a Mad Libs game.
If youâ€™ve never played this game,
a mad lib is a game where you fill in a bunch
of blank inputs with different word types 
(ie : noun, adjective, verb), and then a story is 
generated based on the words you chose, and sometimes the 
story is surprisingly funny.
*/


//Get the value of each of the inputs in the HTML file
//when the form is submitted. 
//Remember the event.preventDefault()
let inputs = document.getElementsByTagName("input");
console.log(inputs);
