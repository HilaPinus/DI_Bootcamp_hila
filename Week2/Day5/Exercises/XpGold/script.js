/*Make A Complete Calculator In Javascript.
Introduction:
Today we will be creating a fully functional calculator.
In order to do this, we must have our HTML and Javascript files interact with each other.
We will be using Javascript to dynamically calculate the outcome of the buttons that were clicked on the HTML.
We will be adding an attribute called onclick to each button.
The onclick attribute allows us to call a function from our Javascript file when the button is clicked.
For example, if you click on the number 2 on the calculator (ie. seen below in the assets),
the function number(2) will be called. The argument is the value of the button.

Create a HTML file for your calculator and a JS file for the calculatorâ€™s functionality.
You must create 3 functions in the js file:

number(num)
operator(operator)
equal()
Hint : you can use the eval() method to help with your calculations.
Before coding, take your time to understand all the parts to the exercise and their process.
You can write it down somewhere if it helps (recommended).
Bonus : create the RESET and CLEAR buttons.

let equasion = " ";
function number(num) {
    equasion = equasion + "" + num;
    console.log(equasion);
}

function operator(operator) {
    equasion = equasion + operator;
    console.log(equasion);

} 
function equal() {
console.log(eval(equasion));
equasion = " ";

}
