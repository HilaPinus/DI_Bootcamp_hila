Here are the rules
If the bill is less than $50, tip 20%.
If the bill is between $50 and $200, tip 15%.
If the bill is more than $200, tip 10%.
Console.log the tip amount and the final bill (bill + tip).

Note: Read the illustration (point 4), while reading the instructions
Create a function named changeEnough(itemPrice, amountOfChange) that receives two arguments :

Bonus: Instead of using a prompt inside the 3 first functions, only use a 
prompt inside the totalVacationCost() function. You need to change the 3 first functions, accordingly.
