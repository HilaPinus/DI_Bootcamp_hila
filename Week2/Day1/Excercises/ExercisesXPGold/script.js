//Exercise 1 : Favorite Color

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.join(" ");




//Exercise 2 : Mixup
//1. Create 2 variables. The values should be strings. 
//   For example:
//let str1 = "mix";
//let str2 = "pod";
//2. Slice out and swap the first 2 characters of the two strings
//    from part
//3. Create a third variable where the value is the concatenation
 //   of the two strings from the part 1 (separated by a space).
//4. Finally console.log the new concatenated string.

//Some Examples
//let str1 = "mix";
//let str2 = "pod";
//let newWord should be equal to 'pox mid'

let firstWord = "Hello";
let secondWord = "World";
let thirdWord should be equal to 'Wollo Herld'


//Exercise 3 : Calculator

let firstNumber = +prompt("first number");
let num1 = firstNumber;
let secondNumber = +prompt("second number");
let num2 = secondNumber;
let sum = Number(num1) + Number(num2);
alert(sum);
