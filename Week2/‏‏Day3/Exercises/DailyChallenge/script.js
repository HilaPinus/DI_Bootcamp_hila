Daily Challenge GOLD: Bubble Sort


Instructions
const numbers = [5,0,9,1,7,4,2,6,3,8];

Using the .toString() method convert the array to a string.
Using the .join()method convert the array to a string. Try passing different values into the join.
Eg .join(“+”), .join(” “), .join(“”)
Bonus : To do this Bonus look up how to work with nested for loops
Sort the numbers array in descending order, do so using for loops (Not using built-in sort methods).
The output should be: [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]
Hint: The algorithm is called “Bubble Sort”
Use a temporary variable to swap values in the array.
Use 2 “nested” for loops (Nested means one inside the other).
Add comments and console.log the result for each step, this will help you understand.
Requirement: Don’t copy paste solutions from Google
